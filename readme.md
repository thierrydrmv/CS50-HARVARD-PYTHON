# CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python 🐍

This repository contains my solutions, notes, and experiments from the **[CS50’s Introduction to Programming with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/)** course offered by Harvard University.

The course covers fundamental concepts in computer science and programming, with a strong focus on problem-solving using the Python language.

## 📝 Extra Practice

To strengthen my understanding of Python syntax, I also used exercises from this **JavaScript tutorial**:  
[Learn JavaScript - Full Course for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qlbbpvp2Y4&t=27328s)

I rewrote several of the JS examples into Python as a way to practice and memorize the language’s syntax.
